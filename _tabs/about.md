Hey, welcome to my blog. Here, I document technical content centered around topics that interests me like CTFs, Pentesting techniques and homelab projects.

This blog serves as both a knowledge base and a way to sharpen my skills by breaking things, documenting everything, and improving continuously.

I hope you find the content useful. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me on Discord.
